    "## 1. Statistics in Presidential Debates\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to scrape Presidential Debates from the Commission of Presidential Debates website: http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=debate-transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you are not allowed to manually look up the URLs that you need, instead you have to scrape them. The root url to be scraped is the one listed above, namely: http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=debate-transcripts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` find all the links / URLs on the website that links to transcriptions of **First Presidential Debates** from the years [2012, 2008, 2004, 2000, 1996, 1988, 1984, 1976, 1960]. In total you should find 9 links / URLs tat fulfill this criteria. Print the urls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When you have a list of the URLs your task is to create a Data Frame with some statistics (see example of output below):\n",
    "    1. Scrape the title of each link and use that as the column name in your Data Frame. \n",
    "    2. Count how long the transcript of the debate is (as in the number of characters in transcription string). Feel free to include `\\` characters in your count, but remove any breakline characters, i.e. `\\n`. You will get credit if your count is +/- 10% from our result.\n",
    "    3. Count how many times the word **war** was used in the different debates. Note that you have to convert the text in a smart way (to not count the word **warranty** for example, but counting **war.**, **war!**, **war,** or **War** etc.\n",
    "    4. Also scrape the most common used word in the debate, and write how many times it was used. Note that you have to use the same strategy as in 3 in order to do this.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "**Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve the questions above, it can be useful to work with Regular Expressions and explore methods on strings like `.strip(), .replace(), .find(), .count(), .lower()` etc. Both are very powerful tools to do string processing in Python. To count common words for example I used a `Counter` object and a Regular expression pattern for only words, see example:\n",
